                    In 2016, Boseman was diagnosed with colon cancer. He kept his condition private, continuing to act
                    while also extensively supporting cancer charities until his death in 2020 from the illness. His
                    final film, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, was released posthumously the same year to critical acclaim,
                    earning him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor –
                    Motion Picture Drama. Boseman also received four nominations at the 27th Screen Actors Guild Awards
                    for his work in Da 5 Bloods and Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, the most for a performer at a single
                    ceremony, winning Male Actor in a Leading Role for Ma Rainey.
